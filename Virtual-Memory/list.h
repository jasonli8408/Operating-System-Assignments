//NOTE: This linked list implementation is different from what you might be used
// to. To make a linked list of items of type struct S, instead of storing a
// struct S* pointer in the list entry struct, we embed a struct with the next
// and prev pointers in struct S (as one of its fields).
//
// Providing and managing storage for list entries is the responsibility of the
// user of this API. Keep in mind that an entry allocated on the stack (a local
// variable in a function) becomes invalid when the function returns.
